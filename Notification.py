Your script is working perfectly! ðŸŽ‰

What Happened?
Notification system started. âœ…
Sent notifications immediately (for testing). ðŸš€
Printed reminders for both patients. ðŸ“¢
Now waiting for the scheduled time (09:13 AM) to run again. ðŸ”„
Next Steps
ðŸ”¹ If you want to change the scheduled time, update this line:
schedule.every().day.at("09:13").do(send_notifications)
For example, to run at 10:00 AM, change it to:

schedule.every().day.at("10:00").do(send_notifications)
ðŸ”¹ If you want notifications every few minutes (for testing), replace the scheduling with:

schedule.every(1).minutes.do(send_notifications)  # Runs every 1 minute
This will trigger notifications every minute instead of waiting for the next day.

ðŸš€ Your script is running correctly! Let me know if you need further modifications. ðŸ”¥
